	<p>
		This page links to multiple python notebooks containing code samples
		along with small explanations in English. Most of the code is dependent
		on Pandas, Numpy and Scipy. Some ML bits use scikits-learn and Tensorflow.
	</p>
	<p>
		The content does not deep dive into the theory behind most of the
		techniques described and assumes working knowledge of Python programming
		language.
